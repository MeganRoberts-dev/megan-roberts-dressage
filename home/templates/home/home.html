        <p class="lead">
          I'm Megan — a professional dressage rider and coach based in North Wales, working with riders and horses across the UK. My focus is on producing horses with care, coaching riders with clarity, and creating partnerships built on trust, feel and solid foundations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began on a stud farm in Wales, surrounded by native ponies and strong family traditions. From breaking and backing Welsh Section Cs, to competing at international youth level, every stage has shaped the rider I am today — grounded in experience, and constantly learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve worked with a wide range of horses — from sharp young ponies to international dressage types — and have learned how important it is to meet each horse as an individual. During my time in the Cotswolds, I was introduced to new approaches to groundwork and horse psychology, which deepened my understanding of communication, timing, and patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning from techniques such as those taught by Tristan Tucker helped refine the way I work with horses, particularly those who are anxious, tense, or struggling to cope. These tools didn’t replace my foundations — they strengthened them. Now, whether I’m schooling, coaching, or backing a youngster, my aim is always to create relaxed, confident horses who enjoy their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach is kind, consistent and horse-first — shaped by traditional values, international experience, and a deep belief that the best riders never stop learning.
