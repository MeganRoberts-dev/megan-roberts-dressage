## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

> [!NOTE]
> I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Adjust the code below (file names, function names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders. Use these notes loosely when documenting your own Python Unit tests, and remove/adjust where applicable.

⚠️ SAMPLE ⚠️

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality. In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

- `python3 manage.py test name-of-app`

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

- `pip3 install coverage`
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- `coverage run --omit=*/site-packages/*,*/migrations/*,*/__init__.py,env.py,manage.py test`
- `coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

- `coverage html`
- `python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the full coverage report on my application that I've tested:

#### Unit Test Issues

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Python unit tests. Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known). This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues. Remove this sub-section entirely if you somehow didn't run into any issues while working with your tests.

⚠️ --- END --- ⚠️

## Bugs


- Fix stripe element java script bug.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/js-bug.png.png)

    - To fix this, I changed the Selector to an Element id.

- Toggler html bug.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/burger.png.png)

    - To fix this, I changed the syntax to span.

- Python `order` display.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/order.png)

    - To fix this, I changed the order_number which was not valid, to order.

## Unfixed Bugs

- On devices smaller than 375px, the about page carousel starts to have `overflow`.
  - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.
